                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I thought about what "hover" meant to me, and thought about the qualities I would want my interactive element to have. I thought of floating things, something magical or psychadelic, and reminiscent of illusions. I also drew inspiration from Yayoi Kusama's dots, which created the basis of what I wanted to make.

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I began by creating the shapes and basic gesture I was working with; hover. My hovering the mouse, the recatngle would follow its position.</p>
                <p>I then progressed to having the rectangle resemble a pen, and draw subsequent rectangles.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I then added physics where the rectangles would fall, and then bounce back up at the bottom of the canvas. This created an interesting reflection where the rectangles would fall and ascend like piano keys. A majority of my coding knowlege was drawn from a previous class, which is where I was able to refer to for a lot of these physics.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>At this stage, I began to play around more with appearance and aesthetics, which is where I was able to incorporate more of my inspiration. I created different types of rectangles, and randomized different properties to see how the interaction would change.</p>

                <p>Once I had randomized colour, I realized what direction I wanted to interaction to go.</p>

                <p>By connecting the colour of each circle to the x-coordinate of the mouse position, I was able to create an interesting effect that fit the psychedelic and floaty nature I drew from my interaction.</p>
                <p>I also connected the radius of the circles to the y-coordinate of the mouse.</p>

                <p>Throughout the project, I also tweaked the physics of the circles to make it suit the interaction more, having the circles float upwards and almost spiral around.</p>
                <p>I created a new shape to implement in place of the circle, but I had troubles scaling the shape, although I did find it also seemed interesting.</p>

                <p>I continued to refine the colour palette and explored with how I arranged each piece of information. I created teh gradient to create more depth in the poster as well, which I thought would add some visual interest.</p>
