                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I thought about what "hover" meant to me, and thought about the qualities I would want my interactive element to have. I thought of floating things, something magical or psychadelic, and reminiscent of illusions. I also drew inspiration from Yayoi Kusama's dots, which created the basis of what I wanted to make.

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I began by creating the shapes and basic gesture I was working with; hover. My hovering the mouse, the recatngle would follow its position.</p>
                <p>I then progressed to having the rectangle resemble a pen, and draw subsequent rectangles.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I added physics at this stage where the rectangles would fall, and then bounce back up at the bottom of the canvas. This created an interesting reflection where the rectangles would fall and ascend like piano keys. A majority of my coding knowlege was drawn from a previous class, which is where I was able to refer to for a lot of these physics.</p>

                <p>I played around with how layering the elements would look, but I ultimately wanted the poster to be readable, so I only made one of the larger typographic elements fixed.</p>
                <p>In establishing the hierarchy of each part, I used a combination of size and colour. The biggest text would be highest in the heirarchy, and the body text was a colour more similar to the background intstead of being stark white like the most important elements.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I added another form of interaction where if the user hovered their cursor over the counters of the letters, it would light up yellow. I thought it would also reflect the event itself being seminars taking place in the night time, as it looked like a light in the dark when interacted with.</p>

                <p>While I moved my large type around, I also had to keep in mind the kerning of each letter, which made for more interesting explorations.</p>

                <p>I continued to refine the colour palette and explored with how I arranged each piece of information. I created teh gradient to create more depth in the poster as well, which I thought would add some visual interest.</p>
